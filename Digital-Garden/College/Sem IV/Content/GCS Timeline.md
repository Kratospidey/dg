On 16 October 2001, as a result of a heavy rainfall a  
small earth slide occurred on the heap leach pad. The  
moving soil pushed a pipe carrying cyanide solution 
from the ponds to the pads and broke it at the coupling  
joint. The solution escaped from the pipe and ran  
down the access ramp into the stormwater ditch from  
where it escaped into the nearby Sumang stream  
through a culvert. The spillage was detected at about  
3· 45am by the company’ s personnel working on a  
conveyor breakdown. In their estimation the spillage  
must have taken place between 1· 30 and 1· 45am.  
Rainfall data revealed that on 15 October 2001 (the  
day before the incident), 12· 5 mm of rain was recorded  
between 3· 10 and 3· 25pm, and thereafter showers of  
rain (0· 1 mm) were noted untill 10· 25pm the same  
day. On the day of the incident no further rain was  
recorded. The earlier rain could have soaked the heap  
leach pad, creating instability, which precipitated the  
slide.

The company had constructed a culvert (contrary  
to design specifications) from the stormwater ditch,  
adjacent to the heap leach pad, into the Sumang drain-  
age area, and this provided an exit for the cyanide  
solution from the containment area. The bridging of  
the protective embankment around the leach pad  
facility with agglomerated ore, to enable conveyor  
repair work, also contributed to the escape of the  
solution to the containment area.  
From the approximately 2 h between leakage and  
detection, GFGL estimated that the maximum quan-  
tity of solution leakage was 900 m 3 of which 650 m 3  
escaped into the environment. Some of the remainder  
infiltrated the porous heap leach surface and part was  
trapped by spill containment measures.  
Detoxification measures were undertaken, includ-  
ing the use of hydrogen peroxide and calcium hypoch-  
lorite. Four 55 gallon drums of 60 vol.-% hydrogen  
peroxide and three 40 kg containers of powdered  
100% calcium hypochlorite were used. Four tanker  
loads of water were then used to flush the detoxifica-  
tion agents down the drain into the Sumang stream.  
Two 40 kg containers of powdered 100% calcium  
hypochlorite were used to detoxify the leakage that  
ponded inside the controlled area once leakage to the
environment had been stopped. The liquid detoxified  
with the two containers of calcium hypochlorite was  
pumped directly back into the lined area of the heap  
leach pad.  
As part of the emergency response procedure,  
company personnel were immediately despatched to  
communities downstream to alert residents, and to  
test the water quality. An alternate source of water  
supply was provided. Bad access road to the com-  
munities delayed the transmission of information on  
the incident to most settlers.
