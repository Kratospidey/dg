## What is the Linux Kernel? Is it Legal to edit Linux Kernel?

-  The Linux kernel is the core of the Linux operating system and is responsible for managing the hardware and software resources of a computer. It is written in C and is an open source project, meaning that its source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute

-  The kernel is the first program that starts when a computer is turned on and remains running until the computer is shut down, managing tasks such as input/output operations and memory management.

-  Yes, it is legal to edit the Linux kernel as it is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), a free software license that allows users to view, modify, and distribute the source code as long as they follow the terms of the GPL. However, users must not use the kernel for any illegal or unethical purposes.

___
