The noun ‘cyanide’ refers to a chemical compound that contains one atom of carbon and one
atom of nitrogen. It is commonly written as CNand it combines with other elements to form
different compounds and complexes. Cyanide, which is used in a variety of processes, is
found in small quantities in many daily household goods such as table salt, coffee, cigarette
smoke, and almonds (Lorösch, 2001; OTM n.d.). One of its most useful properties is that it
can be used in the gold mining industry for the extraction of gold. The most common method
of extracting gold, present in ore, is as water-soluble complexes in an aqueous solution of
sodium cyanide (NaCN). It is then extracted from the solutions (Gurbuz, Ciftci, & Akcil,
2009). Cyanide was used in the extraction process of 90 per cent of the 2 444 metric tons of
gold produced worldwide in 2007 (Larson, Trapp, & Pirandello, 2004, Gold News, 2009).
Sodium cyanide is used in Ghana for the extraction of gold and will be referred to as cyanide
in this case study.

Sodium cyanide is manufactured by the Andrussow process using ammonia, air, methane and
caustic soda. Figure 1.2 provides a simplified representation of this process.

During the manufacturing process ammonia is reacted with methane and air over a
platinum/rhodium catalyst to produce hydrogen cyanide gas. The hydrogen cyanide gas is
then reacted with sodium hydroxide to form liquid sodium cyanide with a solution strength of
approximately 30 per cent w/w. Sodium cyanide can be transported as a liquid, or dehydrated
to form crystals. After dehydration these crystals are compacted into one of three solid forms;
powder, granules or briquettes and is then packaged before transportation (Chemlink, 2009;
Pacia, 2009).

Cyanide is highly soluble in water and reacts with acids to produce hydrocyanic gas (HCN),
which is toxic to humans, animals and plants. Care needs to be taken when packaging
cyanide to ensure that the cyanide is not exposed to sun and water. Cyanide is able to
decompose when exposed to sunlight. In a liquid form, cyanide tends to disintegrate if not
treated with an oxidizing agent such as sodium hydroxide (OTM, n.d.; Lorösch, 2001).

Ghana, a country situated in West Africa, is bordered by the Gulf of Guinea to the south, the
Ivory Coast to the west, Togo to the east and Burkina Faso to the north (Figure 1.3). The
country comprises a total area of 239 460 squared kilometers and is divided into 10
administrative divisions, namely Ashanti, Brong-Ahafo, Central Region, Eastern Region,
Greater Accra, Northern Region, Upper East, Upper West, Volta Region, and Western
Region. The total population is estimated at 23 832 495 (CIA, 2009) using population growth
figures based on the 2000 census.
Lying just north of the equator, Ghana has a tropical climate, warm and comparatively dry
along the southeast coast, hot and humid in the southwest and hot and dry in the north. The
terrain is made up mostly of low plains with dissected plateaus in the south-central area. The
capital of Ghana is Accra, and is found on the coordinates 5º33’N and 0 º13’W (CIA, 2009).
The country has two dry seasons and two wet seasons. In the wet seasons (April to July and 
October to November) the annual rainfall ranges from about 1 100 millimetres in the north to
about 2 100 millimetres in the southwest (Briggs 1998; CIA, 2009; Ghanaweb, 2009).

The trade in gold is an essential part of the history of Ghana and can be dated back to 1471, when Ghana supplied 10 per cent of the world’s gold. Following its colonisation, Ghana was known as the Gold Coast (Briggs, 1998). Today, Ghana still boasts of a wealth of natural and mineral resources, the most notable of which are cocoa and gold. Other resources that are traded include timber, tuna, bauxite, aluminium, manganese ore, and diamonds (World Atlas, 2009). Figure 1.4 indicates the contribution of different economic sectors to the gross domestic product (GDP) of Ghana, as recorded in 2006. Industry contributes to 25 per cent of the GDP, of which the export of gold totals 5.7 per cent (World Atlas, 2009; Intute, 2009).

Ghana is an impoverished country and its economy relies heavily on the production of gold (United Nations, 2009; State, 2009; Information, 2009). After South Africa, Ghana is the second largest producer of gold in Africa (Briggs, 1998). Most of the gold in Ghana is produced by using cyanide in the gold recovery process. The gold production in Ghana can be directly linked to the amount of cyanide imported into the country for use in the extraction process.
