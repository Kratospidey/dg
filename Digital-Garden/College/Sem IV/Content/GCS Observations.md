The accident at GFGL exposed the fact that there  
was little public awareness in the local population of  
the environmental and safety risks that could occur  
at mining sites. Some settlers did not recognise that  
distressed fish in streams into which effluents are dis-  
charged could signal pollution; therefore, some dis-  
tressed fish caught were unfortunately used for food.  
Poor access roads to the communities also prevented  
the timely flow of vital information.  
The leakage of the cyanide solution into the  
environment at GFGL was a result of an unauthorised  
construction of a culvert and the bridging of the  
protective embankment of the containment area with  
agglomerated ore to enable conveyor repair work.  
This could have been prevented if regulatory authori-  
ties had been more critical in their inspections, since  
the culvert in question had been in existence for several  
months before the spill.  
In all cases of spills attempts are made to put emer-  
gency response procedures in place. Most often the  
line of action includes the use of detoxicants. Some  
cyanide detoxicants introduce contaminants into  
water bodies, and if not carefully selected, taking into  
account the soil chemistry along water routes, and  
dispensed in proportion to the amount of cyanides  
being detoxified, can result in major impacts.  
Observations at mine sites indicate that even the  
routine detoxification of cyanide effluents using alka-  
line chlorination before discharge is not effective in  
safeguarding the environment. Visual observations of  
flora along discharge routes in the vicinity of cyanide  
containment facilities in Ghana indicate that products  
resulting from the detoxification processes do have  
adverse effect on the ecology. For example, the green  
vegetation in the areas concerned turns brownish, and  
some flora species disappear.  
During emergencies, detoxification is usually a  
panic reaction and, in view of the inaccurate esti-  
mation of the amount of cyanide solution that has  
escaped into the environment, can lead to dispro-  
portionate quantities of detoxifying agents being used.  
In most cases the quantities of detoxifying agents
used are excessive, as was seen at GFGL, and this  
contributes to the impacts that were reported
