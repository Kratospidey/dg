Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth. The process typically involves the use of large equipment and machinery to excavate and extract the desired materials, which can include metals, minerals, coal, and other resources.

In the case of the 2001 cyanide spills in Tarkwa, Ghana, the mining activity in question likely involved the extraction of gold using a process known as cyanide leaching. This method involves the use of a cyanide solution to dissolve and extract gold from ore.
