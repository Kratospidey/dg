## The Company related to the incident: Gold Fields Ghana Ltd.
### Background:
Gold Fields Ghana Limited (GFGL) is a Ghanaian mining company that operates the Tarkwa and Damang gold mines. Gold Fields Ghana is a subsidiary of Gold Fields Limited, a South African company that is one of the world's largest gold mining firms. The company was originally established in 1887 as the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation, but it changed its name to Gold Fields Ghana Limited in 1998.

GFGL's Tarkwa mine is located in the Tarkwa-Nsuaem Municipality of the Western Region of Ghana and is one of the largest gold mines in the country. The mine has been in operation since the late 19th century, and it is currently an open-pit mine that uses cyanide leaching to extract gold. The Damang mine, which is located in the Western Region of Ghana, was acquired by Gold Fields in 2002 and has been in operation since 1997.

GFGL is a major contributor to the Ghanaian economy, providing employment opportunities and generating revenue through the sale of gold. The company also operates a number of community development programs, including education, health and sanitation, water, and infrastructure development.

The company has faced criticism from local communities and environmental groups over the negative impacts of their mining activities on the environment and local communities. The company has been accused of polluting water resources, deforestation, and wildlife habitat destruction, which have negatively impacted the livelihoods of local communities.

Gold Fields Ghana Limited continues to operate in Ghana and has been working to minimize the negative impacts of its mining activities, through implementing sustainable mining practices, and engaging with the local communities to address their concerns.


## Processes used: 

### 1. Cyanide Leaching:
Cyanide leaching is a process used in mining to extract precious metals, particularly gold, from ore. The process involves the use of a cyanide solution, which is typically sprayed on or added to crushed ore, to dissolve the gold. The gold-cyanide complex is then extracted from the ore using various techniques, such as adsorption onto activated carbon or zinc precipitation.

Cyanide leaching has been widely used in the mining industry for over a century, due to its effectiveness and efficiency in extracting gold from ore. However, it is also a highly controversial method due to the toxic nature of cyanide and the potential for environmental and health impacts if not properly controlled and contained.
