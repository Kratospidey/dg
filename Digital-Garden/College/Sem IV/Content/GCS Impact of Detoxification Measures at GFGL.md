As part of the emergency response process, soon after  
the spill at GFGL was detected attempts were made  
to detoxify the cyanide solution that escaped into  
the environment. Unfortunately, the detoxification  
procedure appeared to have been performed as a panic  
reaction, and the detoxicants used were not only in  
excess, but chased after the already diluted cyanide  
plume. Results of the stream water analysis at the  
community sampling points soon after the spill  
revealed that cyanide levels were below lethal dose  
for fish. Neither the exact time of the spillage nor  
the flowrate of the solution excursion was known.  
Further, the incident occurred at night, at a time when  
no one was around. Therefore, determining the correct  
dose of detoxificants posed problems. The amount of  
peroxide, and particularly hypochlorite, used turned  
out to be far in excess of what was required 
From a simple calculation based on the assumption  
that all the 650 m 3 cyanide solution that escaped  
in the environment was impounded (i.e. within a  
losed containment) to be detoxified, then the 220  
gallons (about 1000 L) of 60 vol.-% hydrogen peroxide  
added was twice the amount that would be required  
to completely detoxify 650 m 3 of 180 ppm cyanide  
solution.  
The 120 kg calcium hypochlorite [Ca(OCl) 2)] sub-  
sequently added was therefore not really necessary  
for the detoxification, and was unfortunately flushed  
down the reaches of the Sumang stream with four  
tanker loads of water. This extra hypochlorite may  
have caused the fish kills in the stream, skin irritation  
upon contact, vomiting and diarrhoea on ingestion  
and abdominal pain. It is known that detoxicants  
such as hypochlorite and peroxide can lead to clinical  
manifestations such as gastrointestinal irritations  
with nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, and irritation  
of the eyes, which were reported by the affected  
communities.
