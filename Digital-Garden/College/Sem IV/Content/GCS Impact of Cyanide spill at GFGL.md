Company personnel found a total of approximately  
50 dead fish of lengths between 50 and 100 mm within  
200 m of the site of the leakage and detoxification.  
Some villagers were reported to have caught distressed  
fish, which they used for food.  
The main complaints from the communities where  
people had eaten distressed fish, or had used the  
polluted water for bathing, drinking and preparing of  
food, included diarrhoea, abdominal pains, blurred  
vision, eye itchiness, skin rashes, skin itchiness, skin  
blisters, skin peeling, bloody urine and burning sensa-  
tion in the legs. These complaints were alleged to have  
started at the time of the spillage and persisted among  
most communities even after five months.  
It must be noted that not all the symptoms reported  
by the communities were attributable to the cyanide  
spill. Some people took undue advantage of the  
incident and, with the hope of making compensation  
claims, complained of illnesses that existed before the  
spill. Most of the eye problems were cases of onchocer-  
ciasis, while some complaints of bloody urine were  
due to schistosomiasis. In some communities, the  
diarrhoea and abdominal pains were also a result of  
unsanitary conditions that led to high coliform levels  
in the water they consumed.  
Generally the community perception was of a rather  
poor relationship with GFGL – borne out by the  
lack of progress towards physical developments and  
improvements in social amenities in these communi-  
ties despite their closeness to the ‘ pot of gold’ .  
In general, the assessment mission on the accident  
concluded that the company took reasonable steps to  
control the emergency and to minimise the impact.  
The impact on flora, fauna and on humans was very  
much similar to those reported elsewhere.
