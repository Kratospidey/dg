> Note that JavaScript distinguishes between `String` objects and [primitive string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive) values. (The same is true of [`Boolean`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean) and [`Numbers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number).)

String literals (denoted by double or single quotes) and strings returned from `String` calls in a non-constructor context (that is, called without using the [`new`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new) keyword) are primitive strings. In contexts where a method is to be invoked on a primitive string or a property lookup occurs, JavaScript will automatically wrap the string primitive and call the method or perform the property lookup on the wrapper object instead.,
