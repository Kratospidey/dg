State and explain Stefan-Boltzmann law.
Back: 
- The Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body per unit time is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature.

- Mathematically, it can be represented as: 
$$E = σT^4$$

- where E is the energy radiated per unit area per unit time, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature of the body in Kelvin.

- The Stefan-Boltzmann law is based on the idea of black body radiation, which is the theoretical maximum amount of electromagnetic radiation that a body can emit. A black body is an idealized object that absorbs all radiation that falls on it and does not reflect any of it.

- The fourth power of temperature in the equation means that even small increases in temperature result in a large increase in the energy radiated.

State and explain Wein’s displacement law.
Back:
- Wien's displacement law states that the wavelength at which a black body emits the most radiation is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature. Mathematically, it can be represented as:

$$ λ_{max}T = b $$

- where $λ_{max}$ is the wavelength at which the body emits the most radiation, T is the absolute temperature of the body in Kelvin, and b is a constant known as Wien's displacement constant.

- The law is based on the idea of black body radiation, which is the theoretical maximum amount of electromagnetic radiation that a body can emit. A black body is an idealized object that absorbs all radiation that falls on it and does not reflect any of it.

- Wien's displacement law is a consequence of the fact that a black body emits radiation across all wavelengths, but the distribution of energy across those wavelengths changes with temperature. As the temperature of a black body increases, the peak of the radiation shifts to shorter wavelengths (increases in frequency). This is why the wavelength at which the body emits the most radiation is inversely proportional to its temperature.

What is a blackbody? Give Planck’s hypothesis.
Back:
- A blackbody is a theoretical object that absorbs all electromagnetic radiation that falls on it, regardless of frequency or angle of incidence. It does not reflect or emit radiation, and is therefore considered to be a perfect absorber. 
- Planck's hypothesis, which was developed in the early 1900s by German physicist Max Planck, states that the energy of a blackbody is not continuous, but is instead made up of discrete packets of energy called quanta. This idea was a major step in the development of quantum mechanics.

Discuss Planck’s radiation law.
Back:
- Planck's radiation law, also known as Planck's law of blackbody radiation, describes the spectral density of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a blackbody at a given temperature. The law is given by the following formula:

$$B(λ, T) = (\frac{2πhc²}{λ⁴}) (\frac{1}{(e^{(\frac{hc}{λkT})}}- 1))$$

- where B(λ, T) is the spectral radiance, λ is the wavelength of the radiation, T is the temperature of the blackbody, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and k is the Boltzmann constant.

- This law states that the energy of the radiation emitted by a blackbody is a function of temperature and wavelength. As the temperature of the blackbody increases, the energy of the emitted radiation also increases and the peak of the radiation moves to shorter wavelengths. This is known as Wien's displacement law.

- Planck's radiation law was one of the first successful explanations of the spectrum of blackbody radiation and it was a significant step in the development of quantum mechanics. It was based on the idea of energy quanta, which was proposed by Planck himself, and it helped to explain phenomena such as the photoelectric effect and the excitation of atoms, which were not explained by classical physics.

Describe the experimental set-up of photoelectric effect and give the experimental results. 
Back:
-  The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from a metal surface when light shines on it. The experimental set-up for studying the photoelectric effect typically consists of a metal cathode, an anode, and a power supply to apply a voltage between the two electrodes. A light source, such as a mercury vapor lamp, is directed at the cathode. A detector, such as a photomultiplier tube, is used to measure the current of electrons emitted from the cathode.

-  In the experiment, the intensity of the light shining on the cathode is varied, while the voltage between the cathode and anode is kept constant. The results show that the current of electrons emitted from the cathode is directly proportional to the intensity of the light shining on it. However, the threshold frequency of the light, below which no electrons are emitted, is found to be independent of the intensity of the light. This result is inconsistent with the classical wave theory of light, which predicts that the threshold frequency should depend on the intensity of the light.

-  Furthermore, the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons was found to be directly proportional to the frequency of the light, and not its intensity, which was another result inconsistent with classical wave theory of light.

-  The Photoelectric effect was one of the first experimental evidences supporting the photon theory of light and laid the foundation for Quantum mechanics.
