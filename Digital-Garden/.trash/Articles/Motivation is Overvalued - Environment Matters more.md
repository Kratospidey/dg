### Page Comment

- quite a good article, it describes that success isn't solely dependent on you but also on your environment which is often overlooked. The simple reason why some people are more successful than others is of course due to their own practices and mindset but the environment plays a significant albeit subtle role in it too thus if properly utilized your environment can be a highly effective tool

### Highlights & Notes

- can be tempting to blame failure on a lack of willpower or a scarcity of talent, and to attribute success to hard work, effort, and grit.  To be sure, those things matter. What is interesting, however, is that if you examine how human behavior has been shaped over time, you discover that motivation (and even talent) is often overvalued. In many cases, the environment matters more.
	- Notes:  this essentially says that hey yes stuff like motivation, talent and other personal factors do matter but a factor which is often overlooked and highly important is your environment
- The primary axis of the Americas runs from north to south. That is, the landmass of North and South America tends to be tall and thin rather than wide and fat. The same is generally true for Africa. Meanwhile, the landmass that makes up Europe, Asia, and the Middle East is the opposite. This massive stretch of land tends to be more east-west in shape. According to Diamond, this difference in shape played a significant role in the spread of agriculture over the centuries.
	  - Notes: basically since asia, europe and such have more horizontal landmass per se and since climate varies more over latitudes and not longitudes it's way more easier and profitable to grow crops in asia and europe
- locations along the same latitude generally share similar climates, amounts of sunlight and rainfall, and changes in season. These factors allowed farmers in Europe and Asia to domesticate a few crops and grow them along the entire stretch of land from France to China.
	  - Notes: so basically a farmer in asia has way more land of similar climate to grow a particular crop compared to someone in the americas
- By comparison, the climate varies greatly when traveling from north to south. Just imagine how different the weather is in Florida compared to Canada. You can be the most talented farmer in the world, but it won’t help you grow Florida oranges in the Canadian winter.
	  - Notes: so due to geographical limitations farming is limited in such places
- As a result, agriculture spread two to three times faster across Asia and Europe than it did up and down the Americas. Over the span of centuries, this small difference had a very big impact. Increased food production allowed for more rapid population growth. With more people, these cultures were able to build stronger armies and were better equipped to develop new technologies. The changes started out small—a crop that spread slightly farther, a population that grew slightly faster—but compounded into substantial differences over time.
	  - Notes: essential a subtle but major different led to a higher rate of growth even if not much which exponentially grew itself and thus the big different between the farming industry of let's say asia and americas
- Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. We tend to believe our habits are a product of our motivation, talent, and effort. Certainly, these qualities matter. But the surprising thing is, especially over a long time period, your personal characteristics tend to get overpowered by your environment.
	  - Notes: pretty much yeah no matter how dedicated you are and other personal characteristics they will be infleunced by your environment in the long term which leads to subtle but constant change over time so the environment has a way greater impact on you overtime than your own personal characteristics
- If you want to maximize your odds of success, then you need to operate in an environment that accelerates your results rather than hinders them.
	  - Notes: this is to say that if someone has a productive environment then his chances of success is way higher than someone with all the same characteristics but not a productive environment
- First, automate good decisions. Whenever possible, design an environment that makes good decisions for you.
	  - Notes: basically since the environment affects you as it is make it so that you have a good environment which would make good decisions for you without you having to put in a conscious effort to do so
- designing an environment where good habits “get in the flow” of your normal behaviors. For example, if you want to practice a musical instrument, you could place it in the middle of your living room. Similarly, you are more likely to go to the gym if it is literally on the way home from work than if the gym is only five minutes away, but in the opposite direction of your commute. Whenever possible, design your habits so they fit in the flow of your current patterns.
	  - Notes: basically if you want to do something then make it a part of your environment so you'll end up doing it way more often
- Third, subtract the negative influences. Ancient farmers didn’t have the opportunity to remove the barriers that held them back, but you do.
- You can also reduce the negative influences in your environment. For example, you can make it easier to avoid unhealthy foods by storing them in less visible places. (Foods that are placed at eye level tend to be purchased and eaten more frequently.)
	  - Notes: pretty much that negative infleunces are also a part of your environment so they will negatively affect you so try your best to reduce them as much as possible upto a certain ex
- It is important to remember that the environment drives our good behaviors as well as our bad ones. People who seem to stick to good habits with ease are often benefitting from an environment that makes those behaviors easier.  Meanwhile, people who struggle to succeed could be fighting an uphill battle against their environment. What often looks like a lack of willpower is actually the result of a poor environment.  Life is a game and if you want to guarantee better results over a sustained period of time, the best approach is to play the game in an environment that favors you. Winners often win because their environment makes winning easier.
	  - Notes: essentially enviroment matters a lot so might as well use it in your own favor rather than just not using it
