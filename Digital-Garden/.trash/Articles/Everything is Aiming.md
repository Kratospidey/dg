- it covers how focusing on the finish line or the target is useless rather focus on how you approach the goal and focus on how you aim not where you are aiming all the time

### Highlights & Notes

- In this goal-based society, success is defined by how our peers evaluate our track record. But what if you’re not excited about this definition of success? What if you’re feeling lost and want to find your way — not the default path, but your own path?
- People tend to use the words “goal” and “aim” interchangeably, but those words have very different definitions. Archery is the perfect metaphor to understand the difference between a goal and an aim, and there’s no better way to illustrate it than the story of a German professor who fell in love with the art of the bow.
- Eugen Herrigel (1884 – 1955) moved to Japan in the 1920’s to teach philosophy. There, he decided to train in Kyūdō as a way to better understand Japanese culture.
- after months of training, and he complained about his lack of progress. The archery master replied: “The more obstinately you try to learn how to shoot the arrow for the sake of hitting the goal, the less you will succeed.”
- Instead, the master encouraged him to forget about the goal, and to focus on the way he was aiming — how he held the bow, the way he positioned his feet, the way he was breathing while releasing the arrow.
-  A goal fixates on the finish line, while an aim considers the trajectory. When we focus on our aims, the process becomes the goal. And we’re more likely to reach our goal when we become fully aware of our aim.
-  “It is not the target that matters. It is not the finish line that matters. It is the way we approach the goal that matters. Everything is aiming.”
- Letting go of outcomes doesn’t mean abandoning your ambitions. Instead, focusing on your aims is a mindset shift that allows you to break free of the arrival fallacy so you can zero in on your output.
- However, we have all been so well-trained to obsess over outcomes, it can be difficult to change the way we direct our energy and attention. Metacognition (“thinking about thinking”) can help us untangle those deeply ingrained patterns.
- The AIMS Self-Reflection Questionnaire is a simple thinking exercise to break free from a goal-based approach to life and help you focus on your aims instead. AIMS stands for Aspiration, Implementation, Metacognition, and Success.
- To refocus on intrinsic motivation, the first section of the questionnaire encourages you to reconnect with your dreams.
- The second part of the questionnaire is about the process of aiming towards your aspirations, when you forget about the outcome and enjoy the journey instead.
- In the third part of the questionnaire, you will reflect on the ways you can avoid living your life on autopilot, how you can monitor your progress, and where to get the help you need when you feel stuck.
- The last part draws on your answers to the questions in the previous sections. Looking at what you wrote in each corresponding section
