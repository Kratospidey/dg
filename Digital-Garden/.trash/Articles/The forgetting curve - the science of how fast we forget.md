- Basically the key essence is knowledge is only helpful and remembered in the long term if it is actively used thus a good strategy to remember stuff would be active recall. One key thing would be that this is not applicable to everyone so try different stuff and stick with the one that works for you.

### Highlights & Notes

- We spend a lot of time reading and studying in the hope of acquiring new knowledge. However, most of us focus a lot more on learning rather than remembering. As a result, our mind is often a leaky bucket we keep on trying to fill, only for all of that new knowledge to soon disappear. This is because knowledge does not only have a learning curve. It also has a forgetting curve.
	  - Notes: happens to me a lot, i learn something and forget it the day after even thought it was quite interesting and that's natural of course this doesn't apply to everything or everyone nor does it happen all the time but basically a leaky bucket is the best example stuff does leak overtime albeit slowly and before you know you have no recollection of said stuff
- The forgetting curve suggests that we tend to halve our memory of new knowledge in a matter of days or weeks, unless we make a conscious effort to review the newly learned material.
	  - Notes: so let's say i learnt x amount of information today, if i don't actively recall it or use it then in a few weeks at max i'll recall just x/2 amount of information even thought i learnt x and it's only been just a few weeks or even a few days
- Use spaced repetition. Ebbinghaus found that repetition based on active recall, and especially spaced repetition, was practically helpful in reducing his forgetting rate. This is because of the spacing effect, which shows that much more information is encoded into your long-term memory — and better — when you avoid cramming everything you want to learn in one study session (which researchers call “mass practice”), and use spaced study sessions instead. The spacing effect has been extensively studied and is one of the few evidence-based learning strategies you can confidently rely on.
	  - Notes: the most simple and effective solution would be, yep just use active recall it's nothing fancy or complicated but it works wonders and i can attest to that. The reason it's highly effective is due to how our brain stores information, basically our brain is way better at recalling long term information but for it to be able to do that the information needs to be classified as long term information and the best way to do so is to use active recall cause the more you use and recall certain information the more our brain understands that this information is important so store it in the long term information section (this is an oversimplified explanation but it can be essentially boiled down to pretty much what i said)
- The forgetting curve should not be interpreted as a general graph that can be applied to everyone. Rather, it is an illustration of how we tend to rapidly forget the information we study if we don’t use it nor make any attempt to retain it.
	  - Notes: pretty much yeah, it's not something that can exactly be applicable to everyone nor does it pretend to be that it just shows how usually people forget stuff and even if you're own forgettiing curve is different that's fine since the principle of the preventive measure is same
- Knowledge needs to be understood, then regularly used in order for you to remember it. This requires a conscious effort and a higher time commitment than just consuming content without any attempt to retain it. As such, be selective with what you want to remember, and make it as simple as possible by using the right tools.
	  - Notes: You can't hope to remember everything even using active recall so you're best bet is to only remember stuff that is worth remembering and yes even with active recall this will take effort it's y no means easy or anything like that but as long as you put in the effort and are commited to it, you'll get the results you want as for the tools there are physical and digital tools available I would say in terms of digital tools the one that i found the most helpful was anki
