- pretty much create a context and a flow around your highlights as if the person reading it later can understand what is being highlighted and why without having any idea of the source material itself

### Highlights & Notes

- I'm sure you have experienced this yourself. You read a fantastic book, like The Invention of Science by David Wootton or Tribe by Sebastian Junger and you mark it up like crazy. As you read, at least every second page has a sentence worth highlighting, what you're reading is just fascinating! And then you put the book down. You do other things, life happens, and a month later you pick the book back up. You go through your highlights. And more often than not, you're just like...ü§î‚ùìüßê. Highlight Dementia.
	  - Notes: Happens with me quite a lot basically i learn this super useful tip or information and i highlight it so i can come back to it in future. Spoiler warning, it never happens and when i do come back more often than not it's confusing as to why i found something important and why something not
- If you can't reconstruct the meaning of a highlight as time goes on, that's a) a shame and b) on you, and no-one else.
	  - Notes: essentially yeah, you're the person who's highlighting the information and if you yourself can't benefit or utilise it then it's your own fault
- Now, why can't people reconstruct the meaning of a highlight? It happens because people don't have a reading strategy beyond "I'm going to read this, now".
	  - Notes: basically they just read it for the sake of reading from what i understand and highlighting shouldn't just be about reading cause hey at that point isn't it just reading-
- The most important thing to do to prevent Highlight Dementia is creating context around your highlights.
	  - Notes: What he means to say is not only should the highlights have a natural flow on their own but also there should be context for each highlight which essential creates a bigger picture
- For every highlight that you make, try to also note down a couple of words on why you are highlighting the sentence.  If you're not sure what to write, think about these questions: - What else does this make you think of? - Is there anything that confuses you? - Is there someone you know who'd be interested in this?
	  - Notes: this is a highly effective strategy, explain why you're highlighting this or what you're thinking about upon reading that text that made you highlight it
basically write it as if future you has no idea what it is but can still understand perfectly what you were trying to capture by highlighting and contextualizing the stuff
- Creating context around your highlights is also independent of the medium you're reading the book in and take your notes. You can write in the margins of a paper book or put notes into your Kindle highlights, and so on. The important thing is that you do more than just "mark up" a text - you have to create context.
	  - Notes: basically how you create context or where doesn't matter all that matters is instead of just putting emphasis on text you're also giving context on why is it emphasized
- The other consideration when "treating" your Highlight Dementia is whether you're doing Synchronous Reading or Asynchronous Reading. What does that mean?
	  - Notes: from what i understand synchronous reading is basically reading + highlighting + actively creating context
whereas asynchronous reading is the same but instead of creating context there and there you schedule a time for creating and linking context in the future
- The first one is Synchronous Active Reading, where you have your index cards, notebook or Roam database open alongside the text and immediately write down the quotes and thoughts you have.  The opposite is Asynchronous Active Reading, where you only have your book/paper and a pen or highlighter. If you do Asynchronous Active Reading, you'll need to return later to copy over the notes you took in the margins and the parts you copied over to your final storage medium.
	  - Notes: I basically always do asynchronous reading cause i find it interruptive to stop and create context but now since i'm trying pseudo-synchronus reading it definitely seems more effective so it is actually better for me or it's just novelty bias
- Asynchronous Active Reading is much more vulnerable to Highlight Dementia than Synchronous Active Reading because the time gap between highlighting and transferring is often quite random, and even relatively short periods can lead to quite a bit of lost context, if you don't pay explicit attention to preventing that.
	  - Notes: yeah this is honestly super important since i do this a lot. I would say "oh lemme just highlight this I'll write notes about it later" and later i have no idea what tf is anything so I've developed my own method for highlighting and creating context which i call pseudo-synchronous active reading basically this is only applicable to articles and such but first create a mental flow of highlights and how they connect to each other while you're reading the article itself then as soon as you're done reading come back to your highlights and start creating context and a flow between the highlights and since you just read the article the context will be fresh in you're mind plus now you have a full picture of the article itself so you know how and what connects to each other
- The storage medium itself isn't as important as the act of returning and transferring your notes over. Whether you're using paper index cards like Ryan Holiday, a "Common Place Book" like John Locke or a digital solution like Roam Research - make sure you transfer things over. Highlights are useless if they're not liberated from their original location and enriched with your own personal context.
	  - Notes: basically this is trying to say that don't obsess over how or where you store your highlights but that to actually store them in a system which you find useful rather than them just sitting in a book or a notepad for eternity
- When you are reading, read actively and create context around your highlights. Then make sure you transfer your notes and highlights to your permanent note storage - either immediately if you're reading synchronously, or set a reminder for when you're going to do it when you're reading asynchronously.
	  - Notes: pretty much a summary of the article
	1. read actively
	2. highlight the stuff you find important
	3. create context around highlights
	4. try to link stuff together and create a natural flow between the highlights and the context so it's easier to understand and process 
	5. transfer them to a proper system whether synchronously or asynchronously
