### Page Comment

- it covers how not everything is necessary and how selective ignorance if used properly can be super helpful and also how to be realistic about ourselves and be a better person altogether

### Highlights & Notes

- “Ignore topics that drain your attention. Unfollow people that drain your energy. Abandon projects that drain your time. Do not keep up with it all. The more selectively ignorant you become, the more broadly knowledgeable you can be.”
	  - Notes: doing stuff just cause you think it is neccesary but actually not important is dumb don't try to do everything instead of trying to become a person of all trades become a jack of few
- Curious minds tend to value knowledge as an enabler for personal growth. For many, acquiring new knowledge is the best way to explore life, understand the world, and connect with other people at a deeper level. In order to expand our knowledge, we buy books, we listen to podcasts, we take online courses.
	  - Notes: pretty much yeah i like to read stuff i find interesting, watch stuff that is fascinating and new basically no one likes to do stuff that isn't interesting to them
- we should not worry about the human brain’s capacity. “Although there must be a physical limit to how many memories we can store, it is extremely large. We don’t have to worry about running out of space in our lifetime,”
	  - Notes: what it means to say is that our brain's capacity while there is not an actual limit since no one lives long enough to ever reach it
- Paul Reber adds: “The human brain consists of about one billion neurons. Each neuron forms about 1,000 connections to other neurons, amounting to more than a trillion connections. If each neuron could only help store a single memory, running out of space would be a problem. You might have only a few gigabytes of storage space, similar to the space in an iPod or a USB flash drive. Yet neurons combine so that each one helps with many memories at a time, exponentially increasing the brain’s memory storage capacity to something closer to around 2.5 petabytes.”
- Given our current lifespan, 2.5 petabytes (or a million gigabytes) is more than enough to store anything you take the time and make the effort to learn. And these are the real limitations to what you can learn in a lifetime: knowledge costs time and mental energy.
	  - Notes: in essence capacity is not an actual limit, time and mental energy are.
- Studies suggest that mental work requires physical energy. While it is still a debated topic, researchers think that constraints on glucose supply result in cognitive limitation. In other words, we don’t have unlimited amounts of mental energy. So, how can we best spend it?
	  - Notes: basically it's saying even thinking requires energy so someone can't just keep on thinking forever without having the energy to do so then if we have limited energy what's the the best way to spend and use that energy
- Deliberately spending our time and energy involves some form of selective ignorance, where we actively decide to not engage in certain activities, to not learn about certain topics, or to not develop certain ideas. To choose selective ignorance is to choose intentional knowledge.
	  - Notes: i think a good explanation for this would be that sure selective ignorance does mean ignoring certain stuff but if used properly that certain stuff wasn't actually important to you at all and rather since you ignored that now you can spend your time better on stuff that actually matters and is important
- “People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.”
	  - Notes: what Steve Jobs tried to say was that "hey yes i scrapped 1000s of ideas we had but that's fine cause those weren't actual worthwile ideas and instead of trying to focus on trying to achieve those ideas I focused on feasible and worthwile ideas which even if not a lot were still way better than the ones scapped" so effectively he did more by doing less
- Selective ignorance is also a way to say no to productivity porn. Instead of trying to learn all the things and do all the things, it’s about taking a moment to ask oneself: is this really going to be helpful? Is this really going to be enjoyable? Will I feel better or worse after I consume this piece of content? Will have I learned something that brings me closer to my goals?
	  - Notes: yeah honestly this is quite important especially consider how toxic productivity culture is, basically instead of trying to do everything for the sake of productivity try to do stuff that matters and in doing so you'll be way more productive than you would ever be by doing everything, TLDR - prioritise your stuff 
- Practicing selective ignorance doesn’t mean locking yourself into a thought bubble. You can still consume content from diverse sources across a wide range of interests. In addition, not all activities need to be productive. Consuming content or having conversations purely for enjoyment is absolutely worthwhile. By ignoring the noise to focus on the signal, cultivating selective ignorance can lead to less distractions, reduced stress, improved concentration, and more joyful interactions with other people.
	  - Notes: and this is something which needs to be taken in consideration essential the term "Selective ignorance" just doesn't mean only viewing certain stuff or only doing a set of things nope 2 things need to be considered for selective ignorance
1. It's totally fine if you do something for your own enjoyment cause even that is actually useful
2. Ignore only the stuff that is not important and or negative but this doesn't include stuff like let's say someone has opposite views on something than me it doesn't mean i selectively ignore them since as long as we can have a constructive discussion together it's fine cause other views do matter and broadening your own views is fine as long as you do it in the proper way
- Pruning unproductive and tedious activities such as boring conversations, negative content, irrelevant ideas, and unhealthy choices is crucial to practicing selective ignorance.
	  - Notes: yep pretty much prune stuff that is truly unnecesary not stuff that isn't necessarily something you agree with
- Critically choose your information sources. Again, it doesn’t mean you should lock yourself up into a thought bubble. Rather, be intentional about where you consume information. For the news, 2-3 sources across diverse political standpoints should be enough to get you covered. Try to read the news for only a specific amount of time, for example with your morning coffee. For timeless knowledge, aim for a mix of sources, such as books, articles, podcasts and videos.
	  - Notes: basically be informed about a broad variety of stuff but find a good few sources which cover said diverse information rather than depending on shady sources
- Cut back on harmful social media. Social media platforms are a reflection of humanity with its spectrum of intentions, attitudes, and behaviours. Go through the list of people you follow, and remove the ones that fill your feed with negative, time-wasting, or plain useless content.
	  - Notes: basically what you see does have an impact on how you act so if something is truly useless and you think you'll be better off by cutting it then just cut it
- Avoid draining conversations. Good conversations should foster curiosity, kindness, and personal growth. If you feel like someone is constantly depleting your energy stores whenever you engage with them, it may be time to ignore them. Seek interesting and stimulating conversations instead.
	  - Notes: exactly that's what i meant it's fine to have conversations where you don't agree with someone but only as long as both of you understand that "hey they have their own views and so do i, no one is necessarily right or wrong and the point of this conversation is not to prove someone as the winner but just to know and learn more about how the the other person thinks and views certain stuff"
- Reflect on your learning journey. It can be helpful to periodically assess your personal growth journey.
	  - Notes: reflection is quite important, unless you don't reflect you don't know what you're doing wrong or right and sure it doesn't matter much for stuff you're doing right but for the wrong stuff it can just lead to bad habits and an unwant result in worst circumstances
- Don’t forget to have fun. Cultivating selective ignorance is not about maximising your productivity or only consuming content with a particular end goal in mind. Doing something fun, learning an enjoyable skill, having a light conversation—these are all amazing ways to spend your time. And, sometimes, doing nothing can also be a great option
	  - Notes: something which a lot of people don't take into consideration, selective ignornance or for the heck of it even productivity itself isn't being efficient 24/7 it's being effective sure watching that youtube video might not be productive but if it's something that i enjoy and me being happy would lead to better work overall then watching that video would be way more productive than not
TLDR - productivity is not about efficiency but about effectivness and not having fun or taking breaks or just enjoying your time is productive too
- By acknowledging that you can’t possibly know everything there is to know, you can decide where to spend your time and energy to cultivate intentional knowledge and stimulating conversations.
	  - Notes: exactly no one is a superhuman we all have the same 24/7 hours so instead of trying to learn and know everything focus on stuff that matters to you as a person
