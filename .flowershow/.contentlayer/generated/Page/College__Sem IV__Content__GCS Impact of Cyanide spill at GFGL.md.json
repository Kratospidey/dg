These complaints were alleged to have  \nstarted at the time of the spillage and persisted among  \nmost communities even after five months.  \nIt must be noted that not all the symptoms reported  \nby the communities were attributable to the cyanide  \nspill. Some people took undue advantage of the  \nincident and, with the hope of making compensation  \nclaims, complained of illnesses that existed before the  \nspill. Most of the eye problems were cases of onchocer-  \nciasis, while some complaints of bloody urine were  \ndue to schistosomiasis. In some communities, the  \ndiarrhoea and abdominal pains were also a result of  \nunsanitary conditions that led to high coliform levels  \nin the water they consumed.  \nGenerally the community perception was of a rather  \npoor relationship with GFGL – borne out by the  \nlack of progress towards physical developments and  \nimprovements in social amenities in these communi-  \nties despite their closeness to the ‘ pot of gold’ .  \nIn general, the assessment mission on the accident  \nconcluded that the company took reasonable steps to  \ncontrol the emergency and to minimise the impact.  \nThe impact on flora, fauna and on humans was very  \nmuch similar to those reported elsewhere.",
