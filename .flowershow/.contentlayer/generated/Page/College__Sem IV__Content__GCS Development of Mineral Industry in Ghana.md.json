The government has implemented policies and regulations aimed at promoting transparency, accountability, and good governance in the sector. Additionally, the government has also established various institutions such as the Minerals Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. These efforts have led to an increase in foreign investment in the sector, with several multinational companies setting up operations in the country. The sector has also seen an increase in the production of minerals, with gold, bauxite, and diamond production increasing over the years.\n\n## Small Scale Mining Sector in Ghana\nThe Small Scale Mining sector in Ghana is made up of individuals and groups who engage in the extraction and production of minerals such as gold, diamond, and sand on a smaller scale than their large scale counterparts. These small scale miners usually operate within the informal sector, without the proper licenses, permits, and regulations. They often use rudimentary equipment and methods, and their activities are not subject to the same level of oversight and regulation as the large scale mining sector.\n\nDespite being a significant contributor to Ghana's economy, the small scale mining sector has been associated with several challenges, such as illegal mining, environmental degradation, and human rights violations. To address these challenges, the government of Ghana has implemented policies and programs aimed at formalizing the sector and promoting sustainable mining practices. For example, the government has established the Small Scale Mining Department to regulate and monitor the activities of small scale miners, and has also introduced a program to provide financial and technical assistance to small scale miners to help them upgrade their equipment and improve their mining methods. Additionally, the government has also established the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM) to combat illegal mining and protect the rights of small scale miners.\n\nDevelopment of Mineral Industry in Ghana.md\n\nOpen with\n\nDisplaying Development of Mineral Industry in Ghana.md.",
