It is commonly written as CNand it combines with other elements to form\ndifferent compounds and complexes. Cyanide, which is used in a variety of processes, is\nfound in small quantities in many daily household goods such as table salt, coffee, cigarette\nsmoke, and almonds (Lorösch, 2001; OTM n.d.). One of its most useful properties is that it\ncan be used in the gold mining industry for the extraction of gold. The most common method\nof extracting gold, present in ore, is as water-soluble complexes in an aqueous solution of\nsodium cyanide (NaCN). It is then extracted from the solutions (Gurbuz, Ciftci, & Akcil,\n2009). Cyanide was used in the extraction process of 90 per cent of the 2 444 metric tons of\ngold produced worldwide in 2007 (Larson, Trapp, & Pirandello, 2004, Gold News, 2009).\nSodium cyanide is used in Ghana for the extraction of gold and will be referred to as cyanide\nin this case study.\n\nSodium cyanide is manufactured by the Andrussow process using ammonia, air, methane and\ncaustic soda. Figure 1.2 provides a simplified representation of this process.\n\n![[Andrussow Process.png]]\n\nDuring the manufacturing process ammonia is reacted with methane and air over a\nplatinum/rhodium catalyst to produce hydrogen cyanide gas. The hydrogen cyanide gas is\nthen reacted with sodium hydroxide to form liquid sodium cyanide with a solution strength of\napproximately 30 per cent w/w. Sodium cyanide can be transported as a liquid, or dehydrated\nto form crystals. After dehydration these crystals are compacted into one of three solid forms;\npowder, granules or briquettes and is then packaged before transportation (Chemlink, 2009;\nPacia, 2009).\n\nCyanide is highly soluble in water and reacts with acids to produce hydrocyanic gas (HCN),\nwhich is toxic to humans, animals and plants. Care needs to be taken when packaging\ncyanide to ensure that the cyanide is not exposed to sun and water. Cyanide is able to\ndecompose when exposed to sunlight. In a liquid form, cyanide tends to disintegrate if not\ntreated with an oxidizing agent such as sodium hydroxide (OTM, n.d.; Lorösch, 2001).\n\nGhana, a country situated in West Africa, is bordered by the Gulf of Guinea to the south, the\nIvory Coast to the west, Togo to the east and Burkina Faso to the north (Figure 1.3). The\ncountry comprises a total area of 239 460 squared kilometers and is divided into 10\nadministrative divisions, namely Ashanti, Brong-Ahafo, Central Region, Eastern Region,\nGreater Accra, Northern Region, Upper East, Upper West, Volta Region, and Western\nRegion. The total population is estimated at 23 832 495 (CIA, 2009) using population growth\nfigures based on the 2000 census.\nLying just north of the equator, Ghana has a tropical climate, warm and comparatively dry\nalong the southeast coast, hot and humid in the southwest and hot and dry in the north. The\nterrain is made up mostly of low plains with dissected plateaus in the south-central area. The\ncapital of Ghana is Accra, and is found on the coordinates 5º33’N and 0 º13’W (CIA, 2009).\nThe country has two dry seasons and two wet seasons. In the wet seasons (April to July and \nOctober to November) the annual rainfall ranges from about 1 100 millimetres in the north to\nabout 2 100 millimetres in the southwest (Briggs 1998; CIA, 2009; Ghanaweb, 2009). \n![[administrative divisions in ghana.png]]\n\nThe trade in gold is an essential part of the history of Ghana and can be dated back to 1471, when Ghana supplied 10 per cent of the world’s gold. Following its colonisation, Ghana was known as the Gold Coast (Briggs, 1998). Today, Ghana still boasts of a wealth of natural and mineral resources, the most notable of which are cocoa and gold. Other resources that are traded include timber, tuna, bauxite, aluminium, manganese ore, and diamonds (World Atlas, 2009). Figure 1.4 indicates the contribution of different economic sectors to the gross domestic product (GDP) of Ghana, as recorded in 2006. Industry contributes to 25 per cent of the GDP, of which the export of gold totals 5.7 per cent (World Atlas, 2009; Intute, 2009).\n\n![[sector contribution to gdp in ghana.png]]\n\nGhana is an impoverished country and its economy relies heavily on the production of gold (United Nations, 2009; State, 2009; Information, 2009). After South Africa, Ghana is the second largest producer of gold in Africa (Briggs, 1998). Most of the gold in Ghana is produced by using cyanide in the gold recovery process. The gold production in Ghana can be directly linked to the amount of cyanide imported into the country for use in the extraction process.\n\n\n\n",
