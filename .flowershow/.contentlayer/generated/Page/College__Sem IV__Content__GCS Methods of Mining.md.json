This method typically involves the use of large equipment and machinery to remove the overburden (the soil and rock covering the desired materials) and extract the desired materials from the surface. Types of surface mining include open-pit mining, strip mining, and mountaintop removal mining.\n\n## Underground Mining\nUnderground mining, on the other hand, is a method of mining in which tunnels are excavated below the surface of the land to extract valuable minerals or other geological materials. This method typically involves the use of specialized equipment and techniques, such as shaft mining or room-and-pillar mining, to extract the desired materials from underground.\n\n## Their Differences\nThe main difference between surface mining and underground mining is the location of the desired materials. Surface mining is used to extract materials that are close to the surface, while underground mining is used to extract materials that are deep below the surface. Additionally, surface mining is typically less expensive and safer than underground mining, but it can also have a greater impact on the environment. Underground mining, on the other hand, can be more expensive and dangerous but it has a lower impact on the environment.\n",
