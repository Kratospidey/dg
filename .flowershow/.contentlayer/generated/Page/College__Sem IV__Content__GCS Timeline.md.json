The  \nmoving soil pushed a pipe carrying cyanide solution \nfrom the ponds to the pads and broke it at the coupling  \njoint. The solution escaped from the pipe and ran  \ndown the access ramp into the stormwater ditch from  \nwhere it escaped into the nearby Sumang stream  \nthrough a culvert. The spillage was detected at about  \n3· 45am by the company’ s personnel working on a  \nconveyor breakdown. In their estimation the spillage  \nmust have taken place between 1· 30 and 1· 45am.  \nRainfall data revealed that on 15 October 2001 (the  \nday before the incident), 12· 5 mm of rain was recorded  \nbetween 3· 10 and 3· 25pm, and thereafter showers of  \nrain (0· 1 mm) were noted untill 10· 25pm the same  \nday. On the day of the incident no further rain was  \nrecorded. The earlier rain could have soaked the heap  \nleach pad, creating instability, which precipitated the  \nslide.\n\nThe company had constructed a culvert (contrary  \nto design specifications) from the stormwater ditch,  \nadjacent to the heap leach pad, into the Sumang drain-  \nage area, and this provided an exit for the cyanide  \nsolution from the containment area. The bridging of  \nthe protective embankment around the leach pad  \nfacility with agglomerated ore, to enable conveyor  \nrepair work, also contributed to the escape of the  \nsolution to the containment area.  \nFrom the approximately 2 h between leakage and  \ndetection, GFGL estimated that the maximum quan-  \ntity of solution leakage was 900 m 3 of which 650 m 3  \nescaped into the environment. Some of the remainder  \ninfiltrated the porous heap leach surface and part was  \ntrapped by spill containment measures.  \nDetoxification measures were undertaken, includ-  \ning the use of hydrogen peroxide and calcium hypoch-  \nlorite. Four 55 gallon drums of 60 vol.-% hydrogen  \nperoxide and three 40 kg containers of powdered  \n100% calcium hypochlorite were used. Four tanker  \nloads of water were then used to flush the detoxifica-  \ntion agents down the drain into the Sumang stream.  \nTwo 40 kg containers of powdered 100% calcium  \nhypochlorite were used to detoxify the leakage that  \nponded inside the controlled area once leakage to the\nenvironment had been stopped. The liquid detoxified  \nwith the two containers of calcium hypochlorite was  \npumped directly back into the lined area of the heap  \nleach pad.  \nAs part of the emergency response procedure,  \ncompany personnel were immediately despatched to  \ncommunities downstream to alert residents, and to  \ntest the water quality. An alternate source of water  \nsupply was provided. Bad access road to the com-  \nmunities delayed the transmission of information on  \nthe incident to most settlers.\n\n",
