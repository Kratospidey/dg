Tailings can be disposed in various ways but the most common practice is to deposit them as slurry in impoundments behind dams. This form of tailings storage facility is the focus of this paper, and the term TSF is used hereafter to refer to tailings dams.\n\nTSF failure can have disastrous consequences to nearby communities, the environment, and to the mining companies, who may face high financial and reputational costs. In 2015, the breach of the Fundäo TSF at Samarco mine in Minas. Gerais (jointly owned by BHP Billiton Brasil and Vale S.A.) resulted in 19 fatalities, and was declared the worst environmental disaster in Brazil's history. The company entered an agreement with the Federal Government of Brazil and other public authorities to remediate and compensate for the impacts over a 15 years period. Jointly, BHP and Vale recognized a IJS$ 2.4 billion provision for potential obligations under the agreement (BHP Billiton, 2016; Vale, 2016). Twenty-one company executives were charged with qualified murder, and up until August 2017 the mine had not resumed operations. The losses to ecosystems caused by a TSF failure can have detrimental effects that can last for many years depending on the nature of the tailings. Samarco is in the process of recovering 5,000 streams, restoring 16,000 hectares of Permanent Conservation Areas along the Doce River basin, and 1,200 hectares in the riverbanks are being remediated with bioengineering and reforestation, amongst other remediation and monitoring activities (Wood, 2017). It is estimated that the livelihoods of more than I million people were affected because of the failure (Fernandes et al., 2016).\n\nTSFs are some of the largest man-made structures in the world. Some of them can be higher than 200 meters (e.g., the Bruno Creek Tailings Impoundment in the United States) and can store more than 400 million cubic meters of tailings (e.g., the Santo Antonio tailings dam in Minas Gerais Brazil, Kinross Brasil Mineração; Figure 1). Martin & Davies (2000) estimated that there are around 3,500 TSFs worldwide, but the real number is much higher. There might be several thousand tailings impoundments in the U.S. alone, associated with active non-coal mining and tens of thousands of inactive or abandoned TSFs (EPA, 1994). In Hungary, more than 1,000 inactive mining waste impoundments have been identified (Inventory of closed mine waste facilities for Hungary, 2012), close to 1,900 in the United Kingdom (Potter & Johnson, 2014), and around 12,000 in China (Wei et al., 2012). There are thousands of abandoned impoundments dating as far back as the 1800s that have not been properly reclaimed or maintained, and that were built with very different standards than what it is required today (e.g., U.S., Nash, 2003; Sardinia Italy, Di Gregorio & Massoli-Novelli, 1992; Ghana, Kofi Bempah et al., 2013; Chile, Oyarzún et al., 2013 and Villavicencio et al., 2014; Hungary, Inventory of closed mine waste facilities for Hungary, 2012). Figure 2 shows the locations of approximately 2,700 tailings dams in countries where information was available (retrieved from multiple sources); many mining-intensive countries are not pictured. With so many TSFs around the world, it becomes important to understand what could be damaged in the event of failure. \n\n![[TSF World Samples.png]]\n\nIn this case study, we use GIS to do a qualitative assessment of the exposure to TSFs considering dam attributes (such as height, storage volume, and elevation) to obtain a hazard rating index with the following steps:\n\n1) An estimation of the volume of tailings released in the event of failure is obtained using similar empirical relationships as in Rico et al., (2008). \n2) The affected area is calculated using elevation data and an estimation of the maximum distance traveled by the tailings, also obtained from empirical relationships.\n3) The extent of the potential damage in case of failure is used in the computation of a hazard rating index (HR), which depends on the affected population, land use, and proximity to high conservation value areas.\n\nTailings dams have unique characteristics that make them riskier than dams intended for water storage (Kossoff et al, 2014). Unlike water dams, TSFs embankments are often raised in multiple stages during the operational life of the mine. TSFs are usually built with local soil, coarse rock, and tailings. Operationally TSFs require strict monitoring, especially for controlling water in the impoundments. Additionally TSFs frequently contain materials that can contaminate the soil and water bodies. Other factors increase the risk of failure of TSFs. Their construction, maintenance, and closure costs provide no tangible returns for mining companies; therefore, there is limited effort to address factors of concern (Kelly et al., 2016). Variations in regulations, enforcement, and compliance can also contribute to variations in the risk profiles of TSFs (Martin & Davies, 2000). Around three hundred tailings dam failures have been reported from 1915 to 2016 (Chambers and Bowker, 2016), but there is no complete database of all historical failures, and the information on individual failures has gaps in most cases (Rico et al., 2008; Kossoff et al., 2014; Martin & Davies, 2000). Many of the incidents go unreported for fear of legal repercussions and bad publicity (Kossoff et al., 2014). However, there have been attempts to study the causes and consequences of TSF failures worldwide using the available information (ICOLD, 2001; Rico et al., 2008; Martin & Davies, 2000; Chambers and Bowker, 2016)\n\nSome of the conclusions are:\n1) Active dams are more likely to fail than inactive dams (ICOLD, 2001). \n2)  The leading modes or mechanisms of failures identified from reported incidents in the past 100 years have been earthquakes (EQ), slope instability (SI), and overtopping (OT), (ICOLD, 2001; Chambers and Bowker, 2016). Refer to Figure 3. \n2) Dams with the upstream construction method are more likely to fail, especially in seismic areas (Villavicencio et al., 2014). \n4) The volume of tailings released is correlated with the run-out distance and the volume of tailings stored, so that an estimation of the potential flood and damages in case of failure can be made (Rico et al., 2008). \n5) The safety of TSFs is inextricably linked to the management and operation practices of mining companies, and the trend of number of failures is likely to decrease due to an increase in company stewardship, better oversight, and regulations (Martin & Davies, 2000; Kelly, 2016).\n\n# Cause of TSF Failure\n\n\nThe term cause of failure in this paper refers to the mechanism by which a TSF ultimately failed. Examples of causes of failure are earthquakes (EQ), erosion (ER), foundation failure (FN), mine subsidence (MN), overtopping (OT), seepage and piping (SE), slope instability (SI), and structural damages (ST). All the causes of failure can be related to faulty design, construction, poor management, extreme events, or a combination of them. The basic factors that influence the stability of a dam are the foundation conditions, the properties of the embankment materials, the rate of deposition and properties of the tailings (operational practices), the height of the dam, the angle of the outer slope, the design seismic event and storm event, and the overall water management (e.g. the control of the pheratic surface relative to the downstream slope, and control of pore water pressure); ICOLD, 2001; Zhang et al, 2009. Extreme floods, earthquakes, and operational practices can trigger failure events. Table 1 shows some causes of failure that result from those triggers (other causes of failure and triggers may also apply).\n\n![[Table TSF Failures.png]]\n\nIn terms of historical events, the causes of failure have not changed dramatically since the 1960s. Considering a 5-year mean moving window, the trends in the reported mean number of events per cause of failure are mostly not significant (Figure 5 top). The only failure modes with any significant trends using Kendall’s rank correlation are: FN decreasing (tau=-0.37, p-value = 0.0003), SI decreasing ( tau= -0.52, p-value = 2.214e-07). \nIf only the serious and very serious incidents are considered, some significant trends are found in the mean number of events (Figure 5 bottom): EQ decreasing (tau=-0.35, p-value = 0.001), OT increasing (tau=0.51, p-value = 2.015e-06) although very slightly (when doing a linear regression the trend coefficient is 0.007, but significant), U increasing (tau=0.38, p-value = 0.00016).\n\n![[TSF Incidents Graph.png]]\n\n![[TSF Serious Incidents Graph.png]]\n\nHowever, the reported type of failure has to be interpreted carefully since as mentioned before, many incidents are a combination of different causes (Villavicencio et al., 2014) and the assigned type of failure can be misleading (e.g. liquefaction of the foundation due to an earthquake or erosion leading to overtopping), and a large number of failures fall in the undefined (U) category. In the case of serious and very serious events, the decrease in earthquake failures can be a product of better design practices (e.g. improved stability simulations, the use of centerline and downstream construction versus upstream in seismic areas) after the earthquakes in Chile and Japan. The increase in overtopping events on the other hand, may show deficiencies in design (storm event) and water management. As Morgenstern (2011) points out, although progress has been made in the design tools, regulations, oversight and corporate responsibility, failures still occur. The next section reviews the evolution of design and risk management in TSFs.\n\n# TSF Design and risk management\n\n## Desgin\n\nThe design of tailings dams has evolved significantly from the 1930s to the present. Early TSFs were constructed through trial and error, but as geomechanical engineering became more prevalent in the 1960s and 1970s, the behavior of tailings and the stability of impoundments began to be assessed. Geochemical concerns related to water quality and reclamation were first addressed in regulations in 1978. Many changes in design methodology and testing have occurred in the past five decades. Currently, various studies are required to approve a TSF design, including plans for remediation and closure of impoundments during the feasibility phase. Local and regional geology, geohydrology, seismicity, climate, and the properties of local construction materials and tailings are evaluated during the detailed design phase. The level of detail in the analyses and compliance to these requirements varies by country, company, and by project.\n\n![[Design Management Table TSF.png]]\n\nDespite of the advances in TSF design, issues remain related to the assumed risk embedded in design parameters and decisions:\n\n- The risk analysis for tailing dams is often deterministic due to the complexity of models and the many uncertainties involved. Many mining companies use qualitative methods such as failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) to evaluate risk associated with TSF options, but the environmental and community impacts assessed are not always accurately represented. A rational design decision approach would be one that considers a probabilistic framework to assess costs and benefits for each mechanism of failure to determine an optimal level of protection. However, one of the barriers to doing such assessments is that considerable knowledge of a process or failure mode is needed. Recent trends in dam safety are favoring the use of probabilistic approaches for defining seismic design and ground motions.\n\n- Design decisions usually favor the option with the lowest capital costs, and although the modes of failure are analyzed, the cost optimization that takes place in this phase generally does not account for the potential economic losses in the event of dam failure.\n\n- There is still a tendency to underestimate the consequences of failure due to earthquakes during operations and to adopt an earthquake loading that is too low, especially in areas of minor and moderate seismicity (Morgenstern, 2011)\n\nThe following section presents examples of risk management approaches for tailings dams.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nRisk analysis is a systematic process of identifying and quantifying possible outcomes and their associated probabilities. Fault and event trees, limit equilibrium methods, and advanced linear and non-linear finite element calculations are commonly used to perform risk analysis in dams. However, risk analysis in dams deals with many uncertainties and often results in deterministic analyses due to the complexity of models. This is one of the reasons why tailings dam engineers have been slow in adopting probabilistic analysis techniques. Sensitivity analyses, which are usually done by changing one parameter at a time, are perceived to be more valuable in the TSF design process than estimating the probability of failure.\n\nSome mining companies use the qualitative failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) to evaluate risk associated with one or more TSF options and discounted cash flow (DCF) for site-specific cost analyses. However, the environmental and community impacts assessed are generally related to land disturbance or direct influence on local wildlife under normal TSF operations and not to losses in the event of failure. Additionally, capital costs considered in the decision do not always reflect potential externalities, so the \"tolerable risk\" is not accurately represented.\n\nA rational design decision approach would be one that considers a probabilistic framework to assess costs and benefits for each mechanism of failure to determine an optimal level of protection. However, one of the barriers to do such assessments is that considerable knowledge of a process or failure mode is needed. Some failure modes such as flood-induced overtopping or foundation liquefaction due to earthquakes are better understood and easier to analyze than others such as piping or slope instability. Therefore, further research is needed to develop methods for estimating the probability of failure for these less understood failure modes.\n\n## Monitoring and Management\n\nOne of the key ways to reduce the risk of tailing dam failures is through the use of continuous monitoring using technology such as drones and aerial images. This type of analysis is not only cost-effective, but it is also safer and faster than traditional ground monitoring. These tools can be used to detect potential failure mechanisms and to update risk assessments over time. It is important to note that even when the initial design concept of a tailing dam is robust, it relies on efficient drainage and specific ratios of sands to slurry delivery. Any changes to the design, construction flaws, or operation issues can compromise the integrity of the dam. Therefore, regular monitoring and adherence to best industry practices is essential to prevent incidents.\n\nAnother important aspect of managing tailing dams is through the use of external audits. These audits, when properly conducted, can help identify potential issues and reduce the risk of failure. However, it is important to note that even if a dam is graded as \"guaranteed stability\" by an external auditor, it does not necessarily mean that the dam is completely safe. This is evident in the case of the Fundão dam, where the failed dam had long-standing problems despite being graded as \"guaranteed stability\" by an external auditor in 2015. Therefore, expert enforcement is needed to ensure the proper conduct of audits and to prevent failures.\n\nIn addition to continuous monitoring and external audits, it is also important to adhere to best industry practices such as guidelines developed by organizations such as the Mining Association of Canada, the International Commission of Large Dams, the Australian National Committee on Large Dams, the Canadian Dam Association, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. These guidelines can provide a framework for proper design, construction, and operation of tailing dams. Furthermore, it is also important to consider the potential consequences of failure when evaluating the risk of a tailing dam. A methodology can be used to obtain hazard classifications that can be updated over time.\n\nOverall, managing tailing dams requires a multi-faceted approach that includes continuous monitoring, external audits, adherence to best industry practices, and regular updates to risk assessments. This can help reduce the risk of incidents and ensure the safety of communities and the environment downstream. It is essential to have an expert enforcement in place to ensure that all the necessary steps are taken and to keep the tailing dams in good condition. It is also important to take into account the potential consequences of failure when evaluating the risk of a tailing dam. A methodology can be used to obtain hazard classifications that can be updated over time.","code":"var Component=(()=>{var c=Object.create;var s=Object.defineProperty;var m=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var u=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var f=Object.getPrototypeOf,p=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var g=(n,e)=>()=>(e||n((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),v=(n,e)=>{for(var i in e)s(n,i,{get:e[i],enumerable:!0})},r=(n,e,i,o)=>{if(e&&typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let t of u(e))!p.call(n,t)&&t!==i&&s(n,t,{get:()=>e[t],enumerable:!(o=m(e,t))||o.enumerable});return n};var y=(n,e,i)=>(i=n!=null?c(f(n)):{},r(e||!n||!n.__esModule?s(i,\"default\",{value:n,enumerable:!0}):i,n)),b=n=>r(s({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),n);var d=g((F,l)=>{l.exports=_jsx_runtime});var k={};v(k,{default:()=>T});var a=y(d());function h(n){let e=Object.assign({p:\"p\",a:\"a\",img:\"img\",ol:\"ol\",li:\"li\",h1:\"h1\",h2:\"h2\",svg:\"svg\",path:\"path\",ul:\"ul\"},n.components);return(0,a.jsxs)(a.Fragment,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,a.jsx)(e.a,{className:\"internal\",href:\"/Assets/TSF_Risk_Assesment.pdf\",children:\"TSF_Risk_Assesment.pdf\"})}),`\n`,(0,a.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Tailings are the waste resulting from the extraction of minerals and metals.
