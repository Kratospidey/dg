International private investor demands for participation in the mining sector were well articulated by various groups including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). For a country to attract private investment, it must offer, in addition to a promising geological environment, a conducive policy, legislative, and administrative framework that is more conducive to business, and a thorough privatization program.

<p>Within the framework of the country&#x27;s economic recovery program of 1983, and more specifically under its structural adjustment program, the mining sector was a major target for reforms to address the concerns of investors and financiers, to arrest and reverse the fall in the industry and to ensure growth. The main purposes of the privatization program have been: to reduce the role of the state in the economy and to improve business competitiveness and efficiency, to reduce the fiscal deficit by using the proceeds from the sales to retire external and domestic debt, and to generate new cash flows through investment and tax revenues.</p>
<p>The policy changes have achieved the desired results with respect to investor perception of the investment environment and the volume and value of mineral output. The country fast became a citadel of commerce and mining in West Africa.
